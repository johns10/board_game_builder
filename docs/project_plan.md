# Space Adventure Board Game - Project Development Plan

Here's a streamlined project plan for implementing your Space Adventure board game using a local LLM for development:

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Create a browser-based version of the hand-drawn Space Adventure board game
- **Technology:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS
- **Architecture:** Modular design with separate data, rendering, and game logic layers

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 days) ✓
- [x] Set up project structure (HTML, CSS, JS files)
- [x] Create basic game config (board path, tile types)
- [x] Implement basic board renderer using Canvas
- [x] Create static board visualization

### Phase 2: Game Logic (2-3 days) ✓
- [x] Implement player management system
- [x] Create dice rolling mechanism
- [x] Build player movement logic
- [x] Develop turn management system

### Phase 3: Special Tiles & Rules (2-3 days) ✓
- [x] Define and implement special tile effects:
  - Wormholes (teleport)
  - Asteroids (lose turn)
  - Alien encounters (move forward)
  - Black holes (go to start)
  - Space stations (extra turn)
  - Meteors (move backward)
- [ ] Implement win condition logic

### Phase 4: UI & Interaction (1-2 days) ✓
- [x] Create game controls (start game, roll dice)
- [x] Build player status display
- [x] Implement game messages and instructions
- [x] Add responsive design for different screen sizes

### Phase 5: Polish & Finalization (1-2 days) - Next Steps
- [x] Add animations for movement and effects
- [ ] Implement sound effects
- [x] Create visual feedback for player actions
- [x] Test and fix bugs
- [ ] Optimize for performance

### Future Enhancements
- Add sound effects for dice rolls, movement, and special tiles
- Implement local storage to save game state
- Add multiplayer support
- Create different board themes
- Add difficulty levels
- Implement AI opponents

## Key Components

### Data Structure
```javascript
// gameConfig.js
const gameConfig = {
  // Board settings
  board: {
    path: [...], // Array of tile positions
    visualElements: [...] // Decorative elements
  },
  
  // Tile types with effects
  tiles: {
    "wormhole": { effect: "teleport", params: {...} },
    "asteroid": { effect: "lose_turn" },
    // Other tile types...
  },
  
  // Mapping positions to tile types
  tileMapping: {
    "3_1": "wormhole",
    "5_1": "alien_encounter",
    // Other mappings...
  }
};
```

### Game Engine
```javascript
class SpaceAdventureGame {
  constructor(config) {
    this.config = config;
    this.players = [];
    this.currentPlayerIndex = 0;
  }
  
  initGame(playerCount) { /* Initialize players */ }
  rollDice() { /* Generate random dice value */ }
  movePlayer(player, spaces) { /* Update player position */ }
  applyTileEffect(player) { /* Apply special tile rules */ }
  nextPlayer() { /* Change active player */ }
}
```

### Renderer
```javascript
class BoardRenderer {
  constructor(canvasId, config) {
    this.canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
    this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
    this.config = config;
  }
  
  drawBoard() { /* Render the game board */ }
  drawPlayers(players) { /* Draw player tokens */ }
  animatePlayerMove(player, fromPosition, toPosition) { /* Animate movement */ }
}
```

## LLM Assistance Strategy
- Use the LLM to:
  1. Generate the initial config structure with tile effects
  2. Write core game logic functions for movement and rules
  3. Create CSS styling for game elements
  4. Debug complex animations or interactions
  5. Optimize performance bottlenecks

## Development Tips
1. Start with a working prototype focusing on game mechanics
2. Use JSON for configuration to make changes easy
3. Test with simple tile effects before adding complex ones
4. Separate visual styling from game logic
5. Use Canvas for better performance with animations

This plan gives you a structured approach to build the game incrementally, using your local LLM to assist with specific code generation while maintaining a clear architecture.
